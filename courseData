 "The course introduces basic theory and algorithms of machine\nlearning. The course covers the following tentative list of\ntopics:Supervised learning setting\nClassificationRegressionUnsupervised learning settingConcentration of measure inequalities\nMarkov'sChebyshev'sHoeffding'sAnalysis of generalization in classification\nValidation and cross-validationGeneralisation bound for a single hypothesisGeneralisation bound for a finite hypothesis classOccam's razor - generalisation bound for a countably\ninfinite hypothesis classAlgorithms\nK-Nearest NeighborsPerceptronLogistic RegressionLinear RegressionFeature transformations and classification/regression in\ntransformed feature spacesVarious forms of regularisation\nRegularization termsDimensionality reductionRandom Forests and Decision TreesNeural Networks and introduction to Deep LearningPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)ClusteringAssumptions behind the algorithms taught in the course, their\nimplications, and common pitfalls\nOverfitting\nInternal overfitting within algorithms due to overly complex\nhypothesis spacesExtrenal overfitting outside algorithms due to application of\nan excessive number of algorithms to a datasetThe i.i.d. assumption\nThe i.i.d. assumption is behind everything taught in the\ncourseConsequences of violation of the i.i.d. assumption\nSpecial case: sampling biasFailure of generalisation guaranteesImplications of the i.i.d. assumption\nBiases in the training data propagate into\npredictionsCorrelation \u2260 Causality\nThe course only studies statistical correlations / dependencies\nin the data. Causal inference is not covered in the\ncourse.\u00a0WARNING: The course assumes solid math and\nprogramming skills. Please, check the \"Recommended Academic\nQualifications\" box below and the self-assessment assignment\nat\u00a0\nhttps://sites.google.com/diku.edu/machine-learning-courses/ml-a.\nIt is not advised taking the course if you do not meet the\nacademic qualifications.\u00a0Physical & Online: This is a physical\ncourse, but we support remote participation.",
