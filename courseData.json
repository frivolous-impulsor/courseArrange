  "content": "Quantum information processing aims at exploiting the laws of\nquantum mechanics to solve tasks which are impossible with the\ntechnologies we have to day. To realise these applications, it is\nessential to make devices capable of processing information\naccording to the laws of quantum mechanics. The aim of this course\nis to give an introduction to how to build such quantum information\nprocessors, both for quantum computation and quantum communication.\nTo this end, we will study some of the leading platforms used in\nthe field today. We will discuss the basic principles of the\nplatforms and where they are today, as well as their imperfections\nand the challenges facing them.",
